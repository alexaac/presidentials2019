Elections Cartograms 2019

Cartograms and Charts using the results from the first round of Romania's Presidential Elections in 2019, held on the 10th of November, with a focus on the first two candidates.

The cartograms show the size of each county distorted by population (the total number of valid expressed votes). Eg. Bucharest(B1-B6), the country capital, is small on the geographic map, but much bigger on the cartograms. The color ranges show the votes each candidate has received per electoral district, in percentages.  SR represents the voters from abroad.
